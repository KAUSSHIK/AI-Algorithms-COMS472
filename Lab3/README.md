# Bayesian Networks

## Lab 3

## The Problem
Lisa is given a fair coin C1 and asked to flip it eight times in a row. Lisa also has a biased coin C2 with a
probability .8 of landing heads. All we know is that Lisa flipped the fair coin initially (the first flip), then
she intends to switch to the biased coin, and that she tends to be 50% successful in performing the switch
(per attempt). Lisa will keep using the biased coin if switched successfully. Suppose that we observe the
outcomes of the eight coin flips. We want to find out whether Lisa managed to perform a coin switch and
when.

Suppose that the outcome of the eight coin flips are: tail, head, head, tail, tail, head, head, head.

Has Lisa managed to perform a coin switch? When?

## The Tasks
1. Construct a Bayesian network for solving the above problem using a Bayesian network software tool (e.g. SamIam). Save the Bayesian network file (e.g. as Coin.net in SamIam).

2. Describe a probabilistic query for solving the problem, and answer the query using the Bayesian network
software tool. (Note: probabilistic queries refer to queries such as P(X), P(X = True | Y = False), specific MAP, MPE queries, etc.)
