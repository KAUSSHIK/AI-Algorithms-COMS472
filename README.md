## Lab 1: The 8 - Puzzle Problem
This Lab deals with writing code to solve 8-puzzle problems. The objective of the puzzle is to rearrange a given initial configuration (starting state) of 8 numbers on a 3 x 3 board into a final configuration (goal state) with a *minimum* number of actions.

## What is needed?
The goal is to solve the 8-puzzle problem using the following algorithms:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- IDS (Iterative deepening DFS) (you may want to check for cycles during DFS)
- A* with misplaced title heuristic (h1).
- A* search using the Manhattan distance heuristic (h2).
- A* with one more heuristic (Gaschnig's heurisitc) (h3).

## Solutions to Lab 1
- The solutions to the lab can be found in the `Lab1` folder.
